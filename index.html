<h1>Website Report</h1> <n><n>
<h2>Usability</h2> <n>
<h3>Effectiveness</h3> <n>

<p>In summary, the site is effective, as you can create an MTG card. It is not perfect, as it doesn't always get the spacing right to make said custom cards look natural/like actual cards. However, the approximation to the real thing is close enough to serve its purpose and as such, after testing, I do deem the sight to be effective for its intended task. </p>
<n>

<h3>Efficiency</h3> <n>
<p>Whilst not agregiously inneficient, still it isn't the smoothest of processes. The image size that the site accepts is outside of the range of a lot of images that you would find on the internet. It offers no in-site way of editing image size and, as such, forces you to edit the image yourself in a different piece of software before continuing with the card creation process. This can be at times frustrating. Otherwise, the process is reasonably streamlined and easy to follow.
<n>

<h3>Satisfaction</h3> <n>
<p>This is where most of the downsides reveal themselves, as the experience of creating a card on mtgCardsmith.com is not the greatest. The aforementioned image issue being one such reason, but also just how the website is laid out. There are far too many adds that cover parts of the screen, that you have to constantly be clicking close for. The formating of the text upon the card at the end is very unsatisfactory as it doesn't take into account the card boarders on the right hand side, whencreating the card image. This makes it so that the subtypes of cards in particular, but also text in the main textbox is often hard to read and is placed over/under other aspects of the image. For the most part it isn't a problem for reading the card, as only small aspects of the text are covered and you can piece together what the card is meant to say, but it leads to a far less smooth-looking and satisfactory visual for your custom card. In my opinion, with modern tech, such formatting issues are easily fixable and I see no reason for why things are the way they are currently other than laziness in implementation. </p>
